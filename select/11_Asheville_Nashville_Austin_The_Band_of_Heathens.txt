A purple sky by dawn's first light
Along the Blue Ridge Range
The clouds fell down on a stone cold town
Asheville in the rain
Too early for the traffic down on Patton Avenue
But there was nothing left to say
There was nothing I could do
I went from Asheville to Nashville To Austin
In the service of a tune
I can't get there fast enough
I'm always gone too soon
I can play the part so well
But I never did make the scene
Forgotten pieces falling in the spaces in between
I raced on over to Nashville
Them southern girls don't wait
Some friends getting down out east of town
Said come and spend the day
The stories that they tell
And the lies that I believe
Sing me one more sad song
I'm leaving Tennessee
I went from Asheville to Nashville To Austin
In the service of a tune
I can't get there fast enough
I'm always gone too soon
I can play the part so well
But I never did make the scene
Forgotten pieces falling in the spaces in between
Heading back to Texas
Across the Travis County Line
The lights were out in Austin
Can't see the city limits sign
I made my way in a 2-step haze
To a door that I once knew
I smiled in the lights of the Continental Club
It's good to see you too
I went from Asheville to Nashville To Austin
In the service of a tune
I can't get there fast enough
I'm always gone too soon
I can play the part so well
But I never did make the scene
Forgotten pieces falling in the spaces in between
