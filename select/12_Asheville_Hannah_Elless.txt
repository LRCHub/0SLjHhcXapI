When you get to Asheville
Write me if you will
Tell me how you're doing
How it's treating you

Do you like your new job?
Did you find a new love?
Is it everything that
You were dreaming of?

Ooh, if it don't work out
Ooh, if it don't work out
Ooh, you can turn around
And come on back to me
Come on back to me
You can come on home to me

It won't be the same here
Without you I'll be fighting tears
When you were over in the war
I fought 'em off before

I'll just stay on the lookout
And I'll listen for the sound
Of your old '34 Ford
Coming down the road

Ooh, if it don't work out
Ooh, if it don't work out
Ooh, you can turn around
And come on back to me
Come on back to me
You can come on home to me

When you get to Asheville
Write me if you will
Let me know that you still
Think about me
