Bitch I'm unstoppable
Odds was improbable
Know if it topple I'll build it again
No, I don't wanna wait
I know there's other things
I couldn't say but I wish that I did
Play it again
Lay out my sins
Weight out my options then you make the pick
Placing a bid
Put it on mine
Know we gon' take it we leaving tonight
Cuz I'm chasing that high
Yeah I'm running it down
Don't wanna lose what I never had found
Don't wanna prove what I know is just bound
To happen if I gave it a second or ounce of my time
And I know it's alright
Know I'll be fine but I'm feeling like I
Needed someone just to tell me it's fine
Tell me a lie just to keep me alive
