I left my home
I left my home
To join the army
To join the army
The day I left
The day I left
My momma cried
My momma cried
I left my home, everyone was weird, I went back
Partially ‘cause of the love, partially ‘cause
of the tax
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck
Don’t ask me where I’m at
Accountant told me this is just life, everything
returns into ash
They named the city after me
So every single time I’m home
I think about doing some things that I should
not say in a song
I’ve done some things that I’m not proud of,
not at all
I meant exactly what I said, but the way I said
it’s
I said it, ah-ah
I said it, ah-ah
I said it, uh-uh
I meant it,uh-uh
I said it, uh-uh
I meant it, uh-uh
I said it, uh-uh
I meant it, uh-uh
There was a time, some years ago
Where I would hate this shit, uh
‘Cause I couldn’t take this shit, uh
Said fuck this town
It turned around
You couldn’t make this shit up
I made my peace
I plant my feet
Too deep
Not moving for none
They’ll build a statue of me trust
They named the city after me
So every single time I’m home
I think about doing some things that I should
not say in a song
I’ve done some things that I’m not proud of,
not at all
I meant exactly what I said, but the way I said
it’s
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong
They named the city after me
So when I’m home know it’s up
They see the benz, they see the rims
They already know that it’s us
I find some comfort in the fact it's not the
same as it was
All this silver in my cup-
Frankly, it moves slow as fuck
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck
I should've never left it
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck
I should've never said it
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck
Take four away from seven
Only person on my street with zero college
credits
For real
(Are you for real)
Every single time I'm home
Think about doing-
(Are you for real)
I should not do that at all
Shouldn't even be a thought
But some how it always is
Guess that's just the way I live
Only person in my neighborhood
Who's nightstand got a grip
And I don't think that I'll use it
All my neighbors old as shit
I should've never left it
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck
I should've never said it
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck
Take four away from seven
Only person on my street with zero college
